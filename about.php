    <p class="lead"> After spending countless hours finding an internship/job for the winter or summer, we often spend even more countless hours figuring out where we will live and who we will room with. Finding housing is difficult, but finding roommates is even more difficult. This site facilitates roommmate-finding by asking each user where they will intern, which gender they prefer to room with, and what college they attend, among other questions. Our hope is that this site will ease your roommate-searching quest and help you meet a bunch of new people you could possibly hang out with during your internship as well!   </p>
